passphrase
==========

A passphrase generator that creates four-word passphrases. Each word is selected randomly from parts-of-speech lists (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs) in order to try to create passphrases that are slightly more readable and easier to remember than ones where all the words are chosen completely at random.
